# hello-world
Hello there!

My name is Kevin. I am a computer engineering major attending California State University of Long Beach. I only know how to code in Python a bit for now, but I plan on expanding my knowledge and using other languages in the future! I enjoy listening to instrumental piano music and like to play video games here and there.
